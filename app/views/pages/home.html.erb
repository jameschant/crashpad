      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are parents of students who have been offered some fairly poor accommodation and we felt we could do better. 
      We have done the houses to the same standards as we would expect in our own homes. Each room is self contained and has 
      access to a bathroom and toilet or a shower room and a cloakroom with toilet. The hall landing and kitchen all have mains 
      operated smoke/flame detectors as appropriate. The roof void has been newly lagged to 250mm and the walls are cavity insulated 
      where they can be. These will be cosy homes in the winter.</p>
